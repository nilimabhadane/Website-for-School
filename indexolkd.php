								<h2>Welcome to our website</h2>
								<p>In Phase-I of the eCourts Project beginning from 2007, a large number of Court Complexes, Computer Server Rooms and Judicial Service Centres were readied for computerization of the District Courts. The District and Taluka Court Complexes covered in Phase-I were computerized with installation of hardware, LAN and Case Information Software (CIS), for providing basic case related services to the litigants and the lawyers. A large number of District Courts launched their websites for the convenience of the different stakeholders. The Change Management exercise was undertaken to train the Judicial Officers and Court Staff in the use of computers and Case Information System (CIS) was successfully implemented. The Judicial Officers were trained by the Master Trainers trained from amongst them for continuing training programme. The CIS Master trainers have trained District System Administrators (DSAs) in the use of CIS. The DSAs have trained all the Court Staff in the use of CIS. The data entry for all pending cases has reached an advanced stage of completion. The Process Re-Engineering exercise was initiated to have a fresh look on the process, procedures, systems and Court Rules in force in the different District Courts under High Courts. The Phase-I concluded with extended timelines upto 30th March 2015.

									<p>Criminal Things offers a new perspective on illegal transnational linkages, international relations, and the transnational. The contributors argue for a nuanced approach that recognizes the difference between "organized" crime and the thousands of illicit acts that take place across national borders every day. They distinguish between the illegal (prohibited by law) and the illicit (socially perceived as unacceptable), which are historically changeable and contested. </p>

											<p>An Ubuntu cum CIS 2.0 Master trainer trained by the eCommittee has written a guide for CIS software. The book has been prepared in easy language. It is for basic level users and first time users. It will be useful for the Judicial Officers to understand about the CIS 2.0 and for the Court staff to know about the features available in the CIS 2.0. The e-book was created with links of demo videos released by the eCommittee on CIS 2.0 and NJDG in appropriate places.</p>

											<p>"The Press will be an ultimate expression of the influence of the University in scientific and intellectual publishing. While thoroughly aware of its primary function—that of publishing the results of scholarly research—the Press will make every effort to balance its program with books in all fields of learning which will appeal to the intelligent general reader.

											<p>The Press will endeavor to extend the University's teaching and research beyond the library, laboratory, and classroom, thus performing a function of a university peculiarly important in a democracy.

...While its interest will be wide, the Press is particularly concerned with the promotion of regional culture and literature in the Midwestern area." —Herman B Wells, 1950</p>
